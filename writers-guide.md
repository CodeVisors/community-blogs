# CodeVisors writer’s guide

We are an open source organization to our core, and we love community contributions to our blog. Do you have something neat to say about us? Awesome write a testimonial for us [here](https://github.com/CodeVisors/community-blogs).

Read our CodeVisors Writer’s Guide below to learn about our publication requirements.
Plus, we've included outlines, example posts, helpful links & more! If you have suggestions about how to make this guide better, let us know.

## Content guidelines 
- Focus on results and learnings. Tell readers how you did something great by writting a blog.
- Provide code examples or tutorials when possible. Our audience wants to be hands-on.
- No overt product pitches. These aren’t received well by our audience, and will not be published on our blog.

## Creating an outline

It’s helpful to organize your ideas in an outline before you start writing. Your outline will depend on the type of post you’re writing, but here are a few prompts to get you started.

**Note:** These are just suggestions. Feel free to change things up to fit your needs.

### Generic outline -> full post process

* Write down the one thing you want people to take away from this post in no more than 1-2 sentences. Be clear and concise. This is your chance to convince the reader that it’s worth their time to keep going.
* Think about all the steps involved in achieving the goal. Write those down. Those are your section headers.
* If any of your steps are particularly beefy, write the steps involved in achieving those. Those are your subsection headers.
* Under each section and subsection, write a single-word bulleted list of the things you will cover.
* Turn those single words into entire sentences.
* Turn those single sentences into multiple sentences where necessary.
* Add a 'Conclusion' or 'Wrap-up' section at the end. Tie everything together by recapping what you’ve talked about and sharing any relevant next steps. This would also be a great place to include any additional related resources you’d like to share.

### Writing about a project

*   What problem did you set out to solve with your project?
*   What was the benefit of using tech stack that you used?
*   Walk us through your process and architecture, including code.
*   Share any relevant lessons learned.
*   Share your vision for the future of your project/next steps.
*   Feel free to include anything else you think is useful/relevant for the post.

### How-to post

* Break your process down into individual steps that are clearly labeled. Each step should be one complete thought or action. Include relevant screenshots or code snippets as needed.
* Recap your process and include any relevant next steps or additional resources.
